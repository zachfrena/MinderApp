# MinderApp

## Design Question: Can the use of a reminder app increase seniorâ€™s independence to allow them to age in place?

This application was developed during a hackathon in collaboration with the Faculty of Nursing at UofC. The app was developed to provide a solution to the challenges surrounding 'aging in place' for seniors and at-risk individuals (memory loss, lack of full-time caregivers, expensive alternatives, etc.). Technologies used were: SQL database hosted on Amazon RDS, Express (JavaScript), Node, Amazon EC2, React Native, and Expo.
